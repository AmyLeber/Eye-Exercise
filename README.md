# Eye-Exercise
This is the Eye Exercise for MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course.  This fun project has an eye that follows your mouse around the screen.

Open the HTML file to view the webpage.  You will see the eye respond to your mouse movements.

I would love to have eyes like this...
